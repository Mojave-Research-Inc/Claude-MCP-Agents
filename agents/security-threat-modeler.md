- **Timeout**: 1800s with 2 retries
- **MCP Integration**: Connected to claude-brain-server for session tracking
- **Orchestration**: medium priority, max 3 parallel

## üß† Brain Integration

This agent automatically integrates with the Claude Code brain system:

```python
# Automatic brain logging for every execution
session_id = create_brain_session()
log_agent_execution(session_id, "security-threat-modeler", task_description, "running")
# ... agent work ...
log_agent_execution(session_id, "security-threat-modeler", task_description, "completed", result)
```

## üîß TOOL_USAGE_REQUIREMENTS

### Mandatory Tool Usage
**Agent Category**: security

This agent MUST use the following tools to complete tasks:
- **Required Tools**: Read, Grep, Bash
- **Minimum Tools**: 3 tools must be used
- **Validation Rule**: Must use Read to examine code, Grep to search for patterns, and Bash to run security tools

### Execution Protocol
```python
# Pre-execution validation
def validate_execution_requirements():
    required_tools = ['Read', 'Grep', 'Bash']
    min_tools = 3
    timeout_seconds = 1800

    # Agent must use tools - no conversational-only responses
    if not tools_will_be_used():
        raise AgentValidationError("Agent must use tools to demonstrate actual work")

    return True

# Post-execution validation
def validate_completion():
    tools_used = get_tools_used()

    if len(tools_used) < 3:
        return False, f"Used {len(tools_used)} tools, minimum 3 required"

    if not any(tool in tools_used for tool in ['Read', 'Grep', 'Bash']):
        return False, f"Must use at least one of: ['Read', 'Grep', 'Bash']"

    return True, "Validation passed"
```

### Progress Reporting
- Report progress every 300 seconds
- Update SQL brain database with tool usage and status
- Provide detailed completion summary with tools used

### Error Handling
- Maximum 2 retries on failure
- 10 second delay between retries
- Graceful timeout after 1800 seconds
- All errors logged to SQL brain for analysis

### SQL Brain Integration
```python
# Update agent status in global brain
import sqlite3
import json
from datetime import datetime

def update_agent_status(agent_name: str, status: str, tools_used: list, progress: float):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/global_brain.db'))
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Log agent activity
    cursor.execute("""
        INSERT OR REPLACE INTO agent_logs
        (agent_name, status, tools_used, progress_percentage, timestamp)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    """, (agent_name, status, json.dumps(tools_used), progress))

    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
```

**CRITICAL**: This agent will be validated for proper tool usage. Completing without using required tools will trigger a retry with stricter validation.

security-threat-modeler
~/.claude/agents/security-threat-modeler.md

Description (tells Claude when to use this agent):
  Use this agent when you need to perform security threat modeling on planned features, existing systems, or architectural designs. This includes conducting STRIDE analysis, kill-chain assessments, proposing security mitigations, and ensuring deployment readiness from a security perspective. Examples:

<example>
Context: The user is planning to add a new API endpoint for user authentication.
user: "I'm adding a new login endpoint that accepts username and password"
assistant: "I'll use the security-threat-modeler agent to perform threat modeling on this authentication feature"
<commentary>
Since this involves a security-sensitive feature (authentication), the security-threat-modeler agent should analyze potential threats and propose mitigations.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: The user is preparing to deploy a new microservice.
user: "We're ready to deploy the payment processing service to production"
assistant: "Let me invoke the security-threat-modeler agent to perform a pre-deployment security assessment"
<commentary>
Before deploying a critical service like payment processing, the security-threat-modeler should validate security controls and create a deployment checklist.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: The user has designed a new data storage architecture.
user: "Here's our design for the new customer data warehouse using S3 and PostgreSQL"
assistant: "I'll use the security-threat-modeler agent to analyze the security implications of this data architecture"
<commentary>
Data storage architectures require threat modeling to ensure proper encryption, access controls, and compliance.
</commentary>
</example>

Tools: All tools
