## üîß TOOL_USAGE_REQUIREMENTS

### Mandatory Tool Usage
**Agent Category**: implementation

This agent MUST use the following tools to complete tasks:
- **Required Tools**: Read, Edit, Write, MultiEdit, Bash
- **Minimum Tools**: 3 tools must be used
- **Validation Rule**: Must use Read to understand existing code, Edit/Write to make changes, and Bash to test

### Execution Protocol
```python
# Pre-execution validation
def validate_execution_requirements():
    required_tools = ['Read', 'Edit', 'Write', 'MultiEdit', 'Bash']
    min_tools = 3
    timeout_seconds = 1800

    # Agent must use tools - no conversational-only responses
    if not tools_will_be_used():
        raise AgentValidationError("Agent must use tools to demonstrate actual work")

    return True

# Post-execution validation
def validate_completion():
    tools_used = get_tools_used()

    if len(tools_used) < 3:
        return False, f"Used {len(tools_used)} tools, minimum 3 required"

    if not any(tool in tools_used for tool in ['Read', 'Edit', 'Write', 'MultiEdit', 'Bash']):
        return False, f"Must use at least one of: ['Read', 'Edit', 'Write', 'MultiEdit', 'Bash']"

    return True, "Validation passed"
```

### Progress Reporting
- Report progress every 300 seconds
- Update SQL brain database with tool usage and status
- Provide detailed completion summary with tools used

### Error Handling
- Maximum 2 retries on failure
- 10 second delay between retries
- Graceful timeout after 1800 seconds
- All errors logged to SQL brain for analysis

### SQL Brain Integration
```python
# Update agent status in global brain
import sqlite3
import json
from datetime import datetime

def update_agent_status(agent_name: str, status: str, tools_used: list, progress: float):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/global_brain.db'))
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Log agent activity
    cursor.execute("""
        INSERT OR REPLACE INTO agent_logs
        (agent_name, status, tools_used, progress_percentage, timestamp)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    """, (agent_name, status, json.dumps(tools_used), progress))

    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
```

**CRITICAL**: This agent will be validated for proper tool usage. Completing without using required tools will trigger a retry with stricter validation.

      ## üîß MANDATORY EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS

      ### Tool Usage Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
      You MUST use tools to complete your audit - conversational responses alone are NOT acceptable:

      **Phase 1 - Repository Discovery (Required Tools: Read, Glob, Bash)**
      ```bash
      # MUST examine actual repository structure
      ls -la /path/to/repo
      find . -name "*.json" -o -name "*.toml" -o -name "requirements.txt"

      # MUST read key configuration files
      Read: package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.
      ```

      **Phase 2 - Code Analysis (Required Tools: Grep, Read)**
      ```bash
      # MUST search for actual code patterns and issues
      grep -r "password\|secret\|api_key" --include="*.py" --include="*.js"
      grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK" --include="*.py" --include="*.js"

      # MUST analyze actual code files
      Read: core implementation files, test files
      ```

      **Phase 3 - Database Integration (Required: Python/Bash)**
      ```python
      # MUST record findings in analysis_tracking.db
      import sqlite3
      conn = sqlite3.connect('/mnt/d/Dev/analysis_tracking.db')
      # Record issues, recommendations, metrics
      ```

      **Phase 4 - Inter-Agent Communication (Required: Task tool)**
      ```yaml
      # MUST call other agents for specialized analysis when needed
      - Use Task tool to call security-architect for security deep-dive
      - Use Task tool to call license-compliance-analyst for dependency review
      - Use Task tool to call performance-reliability for performance analysis
      ```

      ### Progress Reporting (Every 3 minutes)
      ```
      üìä PROJECT AUDIT PROGRESS - project-auditor
      ‚úÖ Completed: Repository scanning, dependency analysis
      üîÑ Current: Code quality assessment (45% complete)
      üìÖ Next: Security analysis, performance review
      ‚è±Ô∏è Elapsed: 8.2min / 20min limit
      üéØ Issues Found: 12 high, 27 medium, 45 low priority
      ```

      ### Database Schema Integration
      ```sql
      -- Record project information
      INSERT INTO projects (name, path, technology_stack, complexity_score)
      VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?);

      -- Record all issues found
      INSERT INTO issues (project_id, category, severity, title, description, file_path)
      VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);

      -- Record performance metrics
      INSERT INTO performance_metrics (project_id, metric_name, metric_value)
      VALUES (?, ?, ?);

      -- Record recommendations
      INSERT INTO recommendations (project_id, category, priority, title, description)
      VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?);
      ```

      ### Failure Prevention
      - If you cannot access files, use Bash to troubleshoot permissions
      - If tools fail, escalate to orchestrator with specific error details
      - If analysis is incomplete due to timeout, save partial results to database
      - Always create recommendations even for partial analysis

      ### Quality Gates
      Before completion, verify:
      1. ‚úÖ At least 4 different tools used (Read, Glob, Grep, Bash minimum)
      2. ‚úÖ Database contains project record and findings
      3. ‚úÖ Progress reported at least every 3 minutes
      4. ‚úÖ Other agents called if specialized analysis needed
      5. ‚úÖ Actionable recommendations provided with priorities
